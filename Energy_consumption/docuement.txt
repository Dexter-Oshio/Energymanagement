The code then calculates the average consumption for each hour, the total consumption for each day, and the total consumption for each month, and finally plots the results using Matplotlib library. The resulting plots can provide insights into the patterns and trends of energy consumption, which can be useful for energy management and conservation efforts.

Seasonal trends: The plot of monthly energy consumption shows that there is a clear seasonal trend in energy consumption, with higher energy consumption during winter months (November - March) and lower consumption during summer months (April - October). This trend can be used to plan energy conservation efforts during peak months.

Time-of-day patterns: The plot of hourly energy consumption shows that there are distinct peaks in energy consumption during morning and evening hours, corresponding to times when people wake up and return home from work. This pattern can be used to identify opportunities for demand response and energy conservation programs that incentivize consumers to shift their energy usage to off-peak hours.

Weekend vs. weekday patterns: The plot of daily energy consumption shows that there is a noticeable decrease in energy consumption during weekends compared to weekdays. This trend can be used to plan energy conservation campaigns that target commercial and industrial consumers during weekdays.

Outlier analysis: The analysis of energy consumption data using descriptive statistics and boxplots shows that there are a few days with unusually high energy consumption, which could be due to weather events, holidays, or other factors. Identifying and investigating these outliers can provide insights into energy usage patterns and help to develop targeted conservation strategies.

Overall, analyzing energy consumption data using Python can provide valuable insights into patterns and trends that can inform energy management and conservation efforts, leading to more efficient and sustainable use of energy resources.
